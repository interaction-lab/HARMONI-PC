# HARMONI-PC
PC Hardware wrapper for HARMONI low-level interfaces

Currently based on:

* https://github.com/robotpt/qt-face-tracking (original source)
* https://github.com/shinselrobots/body_tracker_msgs
* https://github.com/shinselrobots/nuitrack_body_tracker
* https://github.com/ros/robot_state_publisher

Note that the use of git submodules is presently being avoided to encourage modification of any dependencies on an as needed basis. We may later transition to a more proper repository structure as our codebase becomes more mature.
